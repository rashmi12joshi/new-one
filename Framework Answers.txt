What is scope in bean?
===>In the Spring Framework, bean scope defines the lifecycle and visibility of a bean within the application context. 
Spring supports several scopes for beans:
Singleton (default): Only one instance of the bean is created and shared across the entire application. All requests for this bean return the same instance.
Prototype: A new instance of the bean is created each time it is requested from the Spring container.
Request: A new bean instance is created for each HTTP request. This scope is available only in a web application context.
Session: A new bean instance is created for each HTTP session. This is also available only in a web application context.
Global Session: A bean scope that is used for global HTTP sessions in a portlet context.
Application: A single instance of the bean is created for the entire web application. It is used in a web application context.

2.if we dont mention the scope then what will happen(https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.0.0.M3/reference/html/ch04s04.html)

--> It will take scope as singleton bcz it is defualt in bean.Only one instance of the bean is created and shared throughout the entire Spring container. 
Every request for this bean returns the same instance.This scope is useful when you want a single shared instance of the bean for the entire application.

3.what is ref in term of bean reference

--> ref refers to a reference to another bean within the Spring container. It is used to inject one bean into another by referring to the other bean's ID or name.
When you define a bean in Spring, you can use the ref attribute to indicate that one bean should be injected into another bean.
This is done by referring to the ID of the other bean, and it can be particularly useful when you want to wire multiple beans together.

4. what is meaning of ' <property name="view" value="party/AddParty"></property>'
-->The <property> tag in XML is used to inject a value into a bean's property.
name="view" refers to the property being set, and value="party/AddParty" is the value being injected into that property.
In the context of a web application, this could represent a view name or resource path used by a controller.

5. wht is metadata and which metadata tables used
-->In a database context, metadata refers to data that provides information about other data. Specifically, it describes the structurse, schema, 
and relationships of the data stored in the database.In our framework we used the metadata table named as metadata_m.

6.what is the significance of uimetadataproprty table
---> Used to define the lookup,label n input for the attributes stored in metadata_m.

7.what is propertycd and contextcd
-->propertycd is used to define the property of the metadata_m attribute means what we are storing whether it is label, lookup,input else enabling the value.
In terms of contextcd we define whether the attribute should access or display at the global else local context which we define at contextmaster table.

8.what is lookupcd, labelkey, inputypecd

---> labelkey --> provides label for attribute
---> inputtypecd ---> provides the input field for attribute
---> lookupcd ---> provide the values that gonna show in input type (means when it will be combo,fcombo,etc).


9.what is lookupentityname, lookupfiltercriteria, lookupdatacodename.
--->lookupentityname : classname of java file from where we can fetch the attribute.(LoockupEntityName)
lookupfiltercriteria : it will fetch the values from lookupdata as per the given filter creatia.(loockupkey="")
lookupdatacodename : it will provide the variable value from the class that we define in lookupentityname .(loockupdatacd) 

10. What are custom tags, how & where to do we define, declare & use it? Open a tag handler and explain code

-->Custom tags are typically used in Java-based web applications to encapsulate complex functionality into a simple tag that can be used in JSP files.
 This allows developers to separate the business logic from the presentation layer, making code cleaner and more maintainable.

The TLD file is used to define custom tags and their attributes. It is an XML file where the tag and its attributes are described.
 The TLD file allows the JSP engine to recognize and properly handle the custom tag.(tld)

Declare the TLD in the web.xml (Deployment Descriptor)
To use custom tags in your JSP, you must declare the TLD file in the web.xml file of your web application.

Add party.jsp
<ui.Toolbar>

<party:GetParty>---model tag

<ui:formtag>---control tag

17. which queries you have used in framework?
==>Insert,Update,delete,fetch,joins.

18. what will happen if data is available in 2 tables during join but not available in the 3rd table then what will be the result.
-->
1. INNER JOIN:
SELECT *
FROM table1 t1
INNER JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
INNER JOIN table3 t3 ON t1.id = t3.id;

2. LEFT JOIN
SELECT *
FROM table1 t1
LEFT JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
LEFT JOIN table3 t3 ON t1.id = t3.id;

3.RIGHT JOIN
SELECT *
FROM table1 t1
RIGHT JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
RIGHT JOIN table3 t3 ON t1.id = t3.id;

4.FULL JOIN 
SELECT *
FROM table1 t1
FULL JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
FULL JOIN table3 t3 ON t1.id = t3.id;

21.why we use f8.
f10--step over start karto
F8 is commonly used to resume execution of the program while stepping through the code. step in


22. what is debugging.
Debugging is the process of identifying, isolating, and fixing issues or "bugs" in software code. 
Bugs are problems or errors that prevent the program from running correctly, producing the expected output, or functioning as intended.
Debugging is a crucial part of the software development lifecycle.

23. where to deploy the files
standalone -->deployments

		</bag>		]

42. Full form of GUID-global unique identifier? How it is used? 
(primary is unique for table GUID is unique for complete DB)
==>To give GUID is very imp becoz sometimes when we want to fetch a field due to in appropriate GUID sometime data cannot be fetch and system crashes.
So unique GUID should be given.

58. How partyBOValidation file is called ? where do you make entry?
 In our workspace there is a xml file named party_business which act as a guidingfile for the application operation in that it is mention after BO layer control should go to partyBO_validator
& and to call function written inside this file we make entry in validationmetadata_m table over their VALIDATIONCD = CUSTOM and VALIDATIONPARAM = {Function name}written in partyBO_validator. 


minoccurs-->minimum number of time 

label and loockupvalue alag kyuki low code ,no code.

What is dependency injection --Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in object-oriented programming. It allows a class to have its dependencies (objects it works with) injected 
into it rather than creating them internally. This decouples classes and makes the code more modular and easier to test.
